# Tooling with NPM Scripts
This is the repository for my course Tooling with NPM Scripts. The full course is available on [LinkedIn Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/tooling-with-npm-scripts?trk=insiders_6787408_learning) and [Lynda.com](https://www.lynda.com/NPM-tutorials/Tooling-NPM-Scripts/495275-2.html)

While Gulp, Grunt, and Bower are great tools, Node.js offers an alternative for implementing build processes: npm and your package.json file. npm (node package manager) is all about creating custom scripts for common development and production tasks. You can write npm scripts to process and compress code, create services, minify images, and automate all sorts of build tasks. This course shows you how. Join Ray Villalobos as he walks through the advantages—and few disadvantages—of working with npm scripts and the steps for scripting different development and build tasks. Even if you don't use npm for your own processes, many Node.js packages come with npm scripts built in. This is a great course to help you understand how they work.

## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage. Or you can simply add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to peek at. 

## Branches
The branches are structured so that they correspond to the videos in the course. So, for example if I name a branch `02_03b` then that branch corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. The extra letter at the end of the name corresponds to the state of the branch. A `b` means that this is how the code looks at the beginning of the video, an `e` means that is how the code looked at the end of the video.

You may find additional branches that correspond to other states, so for example, you may see a `t`, which means this is a target branch. A target branch is something I use during development or updates of a course and it's for a branch that I'm working towards. For the purposes of taking a course, you may ignore any additional branches. The `master` branch usually has the state of the project as I'm working through it and the final state of the code when I finish the course.
